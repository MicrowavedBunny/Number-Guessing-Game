# Number-Guessing-Game
This is a guessing game I have created as a first project! This is the very first program I started and finished by my self as a labor of love!

I have been working on writing a program as we go through each week and learn something new in my university! This helps me not only retain the information learned but also discover new things and push myself to become better at coding in general. So far this has been an incredible way for me to learn as I go and really get everything I can from the course! 

This program is a number guessing program that has the main menu and three guessing games. 

The first is where you are asked to guess the computer's number. The program generates a random number and the user has to guess what the number is and will receive an output from the program stating whether they are too high or too low and will not allow users to input the same number twice (without telling them). It also tells you how many tries it took you to guess the computers number!

The second guessing game is the opposite where the computer tries to guess your number and it tells you how many tries it took the computer to guess your number.

The third guessing game is a versus game mode that first makes you guess the computers number then retains the number of guesses it took you to get it. Then has the computer guess your number and compare how many guesses it took to guess you number. Then to see how well you did vs the computer it tells you if you won and by how much!
